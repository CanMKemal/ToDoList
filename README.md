There's another work to do.

Firstly i made some changes to html and css codes for create JS to my way but i give up and hold the basics.

As you can see, here is te ToDoList page, we can add duties on list via input bar and it appears below. When we add something, one alert show up to right top corner with bootstrap toast. Also item of added has two options which are canceled and removed. 

It was fun for me, regards.
